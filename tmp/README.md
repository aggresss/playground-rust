Rust is an `expression-based` language

`Statements` are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. `Expressions` evaluate to a resulting value.

Calling a function is an expression, Calling a macro is an expression, A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression.

## Scratch 002

Note that a reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used.

The ability of the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of the scope is called Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL).
